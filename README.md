# Angular 2 Router Book Example Application

## Book

You can find the Angular 2 Router book [here](https://leanpub.com/router). The book is a comprehensive guide to the Angular 2 router written by its designer.

It goes far beyond a "getting started" tutorial and explores the library in depth, including the mental model, design constraints, subtleties of the API, and more. It reveals deep insights into why the router works the way it does.

Reading the book will make you an Angular router expert.

## Examples

I use the same application in all the examples in this book. It is an application akin to Inbox or Gmail. At launch, the application displays a list of conversations, which we can browse through. Once we click on a conversation, we can see all its messages. We can also compose a new message, or view an existing message in a popup. 

This repository contains the source code of the application.

## How to Use

* Clone this github repo
* Run `npm install`
* Run `ng serve`
